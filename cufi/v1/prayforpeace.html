        <b>I acknowledge&nbsp;</b>that it is impossible to be a Christian and not pray. It is like a bird without a song, a morning without a sunrise and a life without a heartbeat.<br /><br />
        <b>I accept&nbsp;</b>the Lord’s mandate to pray for the peace of Jerusalem.<br /><br />
        <b>I pledge&nbsp;</b>to join millions of Christians as we unite in prayer at&nbsp;the same moment in time for the comfort (Isaiah 40:1), protection (Psalm 91) and peace of Jerusalem (Psalm 122:6) and the Jewish people of the world. <br/><br />
            "Pray for the peace of Jerusalem, may they prosper who love you.&nbsp;Psalm 122:6" &nbsp;<br /><br />
            Join us in corporate prayer every&nbsp;Friday&nbsp;at&nbsp;12 noon.&nbsp;<br /><br />
            A reminder has been set on your device.&nbsp; You can control notifications in your phone’s settings.<br /><br />
            Remember, more&nbsp;<b>prayer</b>—more&nbsp;<b>power</b>!
